    <h3>Descripton</h3>

    <p>
        The marinade for this salmon is a mixture of olive oil, honey, soy sauce, lemon zest and herbs. 
        The salmon sits in the marinade for up to 6 hours, then is grilled or broiled to perfection. 
        I intentionally left lemon juice out of this recipe because acids like lemon juice can actually “cook” the salmon as it sits in the marinade. 
        The lemon zest adds tons of citrus flavor without the risk of changing the texture of the salmon.
